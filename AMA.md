<h1 align="center" id="mustafinho-title">:guardsman: Ask Me Anything: Kevin Bravo</h1>

Hello, recruiter or technical person! :clap: **Thank you for stopping by and have interest in my profile.**

Nowdays is realy complicated to know each other, more when you are in a interview and have all kind of feelings (anxaiety, fear...) and short time, so I decided to write this kind of AMA in where I'm interviewing myself for you to know a little about me.


> Each section contains 5 questions or less, the goal is to explain my technical & soft  experience as well as professional interests so that any person could get to know me in less than 5 mins. 


# :eyes: Overall

Actually, the experience that I've applied professionally is mostly based on soft skills. I 've implemented all the things that I've learned as an Occupational Therapy student: I carried out teams, I helped to organize programs and activities , I've been working in teams with people of all different classes… Plus, all the work that I've been doing as a volunteer (currently I have like 800 hours of volunteer work)  Plus, all the beautiful things I learned as a scholarship holder of the AVAA organization.

But, of course **I have Highly technical abilities that I've applied to all the side projects that I worked on, that include planning, designing, building and deploying**

## Occupational what???

Yes, Formally I’m an Ocupational Therapy (OT) Student here in Venezuela. When I started, my goal was to finish this carrer and then study and engeneering realted carrer, but the pandemic came and everything just fucked up.

During the pandemic I started to study Web development through a Scholarship of Coursera, to have something to do during this time because my college was completely closed. Then, I started to dive deep into the blockchain rabbit hole and completely fell in love with all this crazy and buggy and new tech. Not only because the innovation, in blockchain development you need  to have string fundamental knowledge of all kind of stuff (cryptographics, networks, cybersec, system design, behavioral economics, game theory…) and wow, that experience of being in constant learning and at the same time building what probably could be the future of internet is something that I could'nt let go.

## Why study two careers?

Well, my family is kinda diverse, for my father’s side there are a lot of engineers and since I was a kid I always loved to see how my dad disassembled, designed and built things up with all his tools. On the other hand, for my mother’s side there are nurses, teachers, occupational therapists, and, I really love that feeling of being able to help other humans, no matter what.  So, I decide to have a pathway in where I could include partially both:

- **The engineering side**: designing, building, implementing, crash things up and assemble then uthil work
- **The care side**: helping people, communities, not only with health problems but also with social, emotional and communication problems…
  
And since there is no such a thing as engineering care, I decided to go for OT and after finishing that go for an engineering career. **And I'm keeping that decision.**

##  What's your tech experience like?

During the beginning of the pandemic I started to learn how to code, and then I've been building a lot of projects, doing a lot of research, and coding a lot of code that doesn’t work.

I’ve been coding for a year and a half doing side projects, mostly related to blockchain, using solidity, javascript and python

## Volunteer?

Yeap! Actually I’m part of  Pro-excelencia, which is a program carried out by the American Friendship Association (AVAA by its acronym in spanish), an NGO that helps  Venezuelan college students providing them with leadership skills, assertive communication, TICS, English, awareness and Reinforcement of social and citizen awareness with the participation and organization of volunteer activities and projects during their career.

In that program I've been taking part of different projects and activities during the 3 years that I’ve been there, one of them was UMAA (A friendship hand for the environment) by its acronym in spanish, a project that have the mission of promoting and implementing criteria and instruments that allow the protection and conservation of the environment, in addition to enhancing the feeling of belonging of all Venezuelans towards the culture of Venezuela.

## :grey_question: Some questions

### Unit testing experience?

Always recommended, more if you are writing solidity code. I use mocha and chai library for assertions when I testing my solidity code in JS or Pytest if im working with python

### TDD experience?

I know the theory and concepts behind TDD and I've applied them to the projects that I worked on, but of course not in a business way.

### Can you create a palindrome, then revert a linked list where the first entry needs to… and at the same time design a cripto economic system that can solve the world’s inequality problem?

Ok, I have strong problem solving and communication abilities that I can apply for most situations that I could find.

# :dancer: What Would you Ask & Seek at Your Next Company?

<!-- ## What are your meetings like? How many per week would I be expecting in this role?

I consider meetings to be a low productive activity within companies yet somehow we tend to think they are productive. There's tons of research that show otherwise. Non-planned meetings, "urgent" same-day meetings, meetings with no identifiable action items... If your role is to have me on back-to-back meetings just because, I would be not interested in the position. -->

## If we remove money off the table, what would you say is important for your next gig?

In order of importance:

- **Culture:** I would like to work with people trying to build something they are proud of, or probably they are still not proud of, but at least they want to get there. 
- **Intellectual curiosity:** I would like to work in a company that is always pushing it's team towards excellence, with an insatiable desire for never stop learning
- **Flexibility:**  I would like to work in a company that understands not everyone runs on the same schedule and that looks for punched out tasks and getting things done rather than punched out hours.
- **Company mission & values:** I would like to work in a company that really believes in what they are saying, not only because of money, of course it's important, but more important is to leave a footprint in all those possible lives we can change with the product that we could work on.

## Your perfect job description:

*"We are looking for a friky adept technologist to work alongside us building our protocol and improving our exciting products. You'll spend time researching the most efficient way in which you can write smart contracts, Designing reviewing and innovating to improve the protocol.*

## Getting to Know Me

### How do you keep yourself up to date?

It is a bit of mix & match

- I am active on Twitter and usually follow devs and projects I am interested in. I usually find important updates, or links to talks, events, and technical tutorials.
- Medium, I like the technical articles published here which tend to go more in-depth and technical than random tweets and subreddits. 
- Online Courses & Training, currently I don't have a subscription for a learning platform because I cannot afford it, but in general when Pluralsight gives its free weekend I enjoy taking one or two courses a lot, usually I learn through free courses on youtube. And I’ve been taking some of the hands on projects offered by [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/)
<!-- 
 ### Youtube channels I recommend 
   - Patrick Collins
   - Free Code Camp
   - Encode club
   - ETH Global
   - Moralis
   - Eat the blocks -->

### What are you currently working on?

Currently I'm working on two projectThe OT website and  the Arepachain Blockchain. But also I'm currently in a self learning process in which I'm learning about crypto primitives and Token economics (Bonding Curves, Prediction Markets, Token Curated Registries) and how to apply them on smart contracts.
