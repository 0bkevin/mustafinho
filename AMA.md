Hello, recruiter or technical person! Thank you for stopping by and for the interest in my profile.

Nowdays is realy complicated to know each other, more when you are in a interview and have all those feelings, (anxaiety, fear...) so i decided to write this kind of AMA in where i'm interviewing myself for you to know a little about me and don't waste time in our interview.
