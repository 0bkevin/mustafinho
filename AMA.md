<h1 align="center" id="mustafinho-title">:guardsman: Ask Me Anything: Kevin Bravo</h1>

Hello, recruiter or technical person! :clap: **Thank you for stopping by and have interest in my profile.**

Getting to know a candidate can be a challenging task, more when you are in a interview and have all kind of feelings (anxiety, fear...) and short time, so I decided to write this kind of AMA in where I'm interviewing myself for you to know me. 

> Each section contains 5 questions or less, the goal is to explain my technical & soft  experience as well as professional interests so that any person could get to know me in less than 5 mins. 
# :eyes: Overall.


##  What's your tech experience like?

I've been working for the past 6 months in the NGO where I'm currently a Scholarship holder as an intern.

My work has been mostly helping improve internal processes in the organization. Previously the organization had a very inefficient way to manage data and time consuming and inneficient processes to make thighs work. 

I actually built some systems that help improve those processes and make the internal work more efficient and automatic.

For example, a process that used to take one to one and a half hours to be done manually, now takes less than 5 minutes. 

 Also, I improve the way in which the organization keeps track of the alumni data and progress during their stay in the program and also once they leave it, making it more efficient how they keep track of all the alumni data. 

Those systems were mostly built by using Google App Scripts with Typescript and some scripts in python that help connect diverse products and automate processes.

If you want to know more about that you can check this.

More related to the blockchain space, I built some personal projects to keep me constantly learning and improving my abilities with Solidity, Cairo, typescript and python

## Volunteer?

Yeap! Currently I’m part of the Excellence Program (Pro-Excelencia), which is a program carried out by the Venezuelan American Friendship Association (AVAA by its acronym in spanish), an NGO that helps Venezuelan college students providing them with leadership and assertive communication skills, TICS, English and Reinforcement of social and citizen awareness with the participation of volunteer activities and projects during their career.

During the 3 years that I’ve been there I've been taking part in different projects and activities. One of them "A friendly Hand for the Environment" (UMAA) by its acronym in spanish, a project that have the mission of promoting and implementing criteria and instruments that allow the protection and conservation of the environment, in addition to enhancing the feeling of belonging of all Venezuelans towards the culture of Venezuela.

  <span align = "left"> Currently, I’m part of the Commitment Committee in AVAA which is a position in where I have to design action plans to improve compliance of the commitments by the fellows and help them with all the different questions and concerns that they could have about the program

Until now I improved the onboarding process of the new scholarship holders by creating a program called “Partner with a Green Heart”. It is an initiative in which those interested scholarship holders with more experience within the program ("Senior Scholars") commit to be a guide for those scholarship holders who are just beginning their path within the Program ("Junior Scholars") 

Having great results when we implement it in the cohort of May 2022, currently the initiative is taking place with the new scholars of the Cohort of november 2022.  

Adding that also I do volunteer with other NGO here in Venezuela, Like Techo,

### What are your professional Goals?

My goal in the future is continuing my professional studies, until reaching a PHD level because I want to reach that point in my life where I can share and create new knowledge, not in an amateur way but proffesionally. I really love the college environment, so I want to continue studying but at the same time creating and gaining experience along the way while contributing to the tech community as I gain new knowledge and experience that can be usefull for others.

## :grey_question: Some questions

### Unit testing experience?

I use mocha and chai library for assertions when I testing my solidity code in JS or Pytest if im working with python. Actually, every project that I built i've implemented unit test. 

### TDD experience?

I know the theory and concepts behind TDD and I've applied them on the projects that I worked on.

### Have you had experience with solidity security best practices?

Yes, in fact this is one of the areas in which I have more insteres in the blockchain space. Along with tokenomic, I really like doing research about the hacks that are happening in the ecosystem to learn from them.

### Can you create a palindrome, then revert a linked list where the first entry needs to… and at the same time design a crypto economic system that can solve the world’s inequality problem?

Ok, I have strong problem solving and communication abilities that I can apply for most situations that I could find.

## What are you looking for in a company?
. 
My goal is to get involved in the exciting and freaking out startup environment, working out to raise a company from the bottom to the top..

I don't want to work in a monotonous company in which everything is perfect and most of the processes are already established. I want to create those processes. Propose, design ideas and implement them 

I want to work in a company that really believes in what they are doing, a company that wants to make some real change in the way we use things (for better) to improve people’s lives.


# :dancer: What Would You Ask & Seek at Your Next Company?

## If we remove money off the table, what would you say is important for your next gig?

In order of importance:

- **Culture:** I would love to work in the insane and shockingly startup ecosystem, with people trying to build something they are proud of and can have a real impact in the world improving people's live. 
- **Intellectual curiosity:** I would like to work in a company that is always pushing it's team towards excellence, with an insatiable desire for never stop learning
- **Flexibility:**  I would like to work in a company that understands not everyone runs on the same schedule and that looks for punched out tasks and getting things done rather than punched out hours.
- **Company mission & values:** I would like to work in a company that really believes in what they are saying, not only because of money, of course it's important, but more important is to leave a footprint in all those possible lives we can change with the product that we could work on.

## Your perfect job description:

*"We are looking for a friky adept technologist to work alongside us building our protocol, making research for improving our exciting products.. You'll spend time researching the most efficient way in which you can write smart contracts, Designing reviewing and innovating to improve the protocol.*

*So, you'll help us out first of all; designing, coding, testing and deploying smart contracts, review exciting code written by other team members, research, architect, and develop innovation solutions to scale the protocol, define new features in order to contribute to building a great user experience, help build reliable and scalable systems with a strong focus on security (even trying implementing new l2 solutions), provide documentation, guides, and support, acting as a second line of support and helping our community leads as needed, coordinate with main stakeholders in the space to drive forward new standards for smart contracts, leading the technical team in a bunch of features across multiple stacks, explain features to stakeholders from technical to non-technical.*

*Lastly, we´ll avoid booking unnecessary meetings in your day and we'll also give back to the dev community in general through Meetups, events, or even a big check to open source, etc...*

*Welcome aboard!."*

## Getting to Know Me

### How do you keep yourself up to date?

It's a bit of mix & match

- I am active on Twitter and usually follow devs and projects I am interested in. I usually find important updates, or links to talks, events, and technical tutorials.
- Medium, I like the technical articles published here which tend to go more in-depth and technical than random tweets and subreddits. 
- Online Courses & Training, currently I don't have a subscription for a learning platform because I cannot afford it, but in general when Pluralsight gives its free weekend I enjoy taking one or two courses a lot, usually I learn through free courses on youtube. And I’ve been taking some of the hands on projects offered by [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/)
<!-- 
 ### Youtube channels I recommend 
   - Patrick Collins
   - Free Code Camp
   - Encode club
   - ETH Global
   - Moralis
   - Eat the blocks

### What are you currently working on?

I'm currently in a self learning process in which I'm learning about ZK-Proof and the primitive mechanisms that make them possible. Also currently building some Cairo Stuff.  

### What interests you most in the blockchain space?

Tokenomics (Bonding Curves, Prediction Markets, Token Curated Registries) and how to apply them on smart contracts, EVM dynamics, Interoperability between blockchains and L2s and ZK - Proof.
