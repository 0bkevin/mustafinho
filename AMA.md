Hello, recruiter or technical person! Thank you for stopping by and have interest in my profile.

Nowdays is realy complicated to know each other, more when you are in a interview and have all those feelings, (anxaiety, fear...) so I decided to write this kind of AMA in where I'm interviewing myself for you to know a little about me.

## Overall

Actually, the experience that I've applied professionally is mostly based on soft skills. I 've implemented all the things that I've learned as an Occupational Therapy student: I carried out teams, I helped to organize programs and activities , I've been working in teams with people of all different classes… Plus, all the work that I've been doing as a volunteer (currently I have like 800 hours of volunteer work)  Plus, all the beautiful things I learned as a scholarship holder of the AVAA organization.

But, of course I have Highly technical abilities that I've applied to all the side projects that I worked on, that include planning, designing, building and deploying

### Occupational what???

Yes, Formally I’m an Ocupational Therapy (OT) Student Here in venezuela, when I started my goal was to finish this carrer and then study and engeneering realted carrer , but the pandemic came and everything just fucked up. During the pandemic I started to study Web development through a Scholarship of Coursera, to have something to do during this time, because my college literally was completely closed. Then, I started to dive deep into the blockchain rabbit hole and completely fell in love with all this crazy and buggy and new tech. Not only because the innovation, in blockchain development you need  to have string fundamental knowledge of all kind of stuff (cryptographics, networks, cybersec, system design, behavioral economics, game theory…) and wow, that experience of being in constant learning and at the same time building what probably could be the future of internet is something that i can’t let go.

### Why study two careers?

Well, my family is kinda diverse, for my father’s side there are a lot of engineers and since  I was a kid I always loved to see how my dad disassembled, designed and built things up with all his tools. On the other hand, for my mother’s side there are nurses, teachers, occupational therapists, and, I really love that feeling of being able to help other humans, no matter what.  So, I decide to have a pathway in where I could include partially both:

- **The engineering side**: designing, building, implementing, crash things up and assemble then uthil work
- **The care side**: helping people, communities, not only with health problems but also with social, emotional and communication problems…
  
And since there is no such a thing as engineering care, I decided to go for OT and after finishing that go for an engineering career. **And I'm keeping that decision.**

### What's your tech experience like?

During the beginning of the pandemic I started to learn how to code, and then I've been building a lot of projects, doing a lot of research, and coding a lot of code that doesn’t work.

I’ve been coding for a year and a half doing side projects, mostly related to blockchain, using solidity, javascript and python

### Volunteer?

Yeap! Actually I’m part of  Pro-excelencia, which is a program carried out by the American Friendship Association (AVAA by its acronym in spanish), an NGO that helps  Venezuelan college students providing them with leadership skills, assertive communication, TICS, English, awareness and Reinforcement of social and citizen awareness with the participation and organization of volunteer activities and projects during their career.

In that program I've been taking part of different projects and activities during the 3 years that I’ve been there, one of them was UMAA (A friendship hand for the environment) by its acronym in spanish, a project that have the mission of promoting and implementing criteria and instruments that allow the protection and conservation of the environment, in addition to enhancing the feeling of belonging of all Venezuelans towards the culture of Venezuela.
